<p>Debating whether to rent versus buy a forklift or other material handling equipment? Pallet jacks come in a several types , including manual kinds, as well as electric-powered units, but the basic design is always the same: Two forks are positioned horizontal to the floor, allowing the operator to slide the jack under a pallet. Cherry Pickers are found in warehouse environments where they prepare orders for shipment using the cherry picker machine.</p>
<p>These are Sit-down forklifts designed for indoor use with solid, cushioned tires — powered by internal-combustion (IC) engines that run on diesel fuel or, more commonly, LP gas. You don't want a truck that was lifted by some random mechanic since there is no guarantee the mechanic knows what he or she is doing. Since they can easily move from indoor to exterior jobs, these machines are remarkably flexible.</p>

The Rental Department of Raymond Storage Concepts strives to provide quality equipment and solutions to your short and long-term rental needs. The answer is similar to electric forklifts above.

Counterbalance forklifts are one of the most popular types of powered industrial trucks used today, and the U.S. Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) requires counterbalance forklift training for any operator using this type of lift.

Larger items may be attached to a pallet or have indents for fork lifting built into the item itself. Manufacturing Areas: While rough terrain forklifts aren't designed for indoor use, you can put them to work in enclosed spaces.</p>
