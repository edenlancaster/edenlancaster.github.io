<p>Cumulative lift truck production in Japan reached 500,000 vehicles in 1985, and global cumulative lift truck production reached one million vehicles in August 1995. Ohio Power Tool is proud to be one of the exclusive distributors and repair facilities for Gray jacks and lifts. These drivers should not forego lifted trucks, but should consider a lower height that would accomplish their goal without exceeding what is necessary.</p>
<p>A lifted truck also has a higher resale value because of how valuable these trucks are. We have used lifted trucks in stock from time-to-time, but we cannot guarantee availability on pre-owned models due to frequent changes in our inventory. As a result, customers should contact our team with questions about these suspension lift kits. The taller tires get the differential higher off the ground, reducing the risk of damage from obstacles, and all four wheels gain maximum traction due to the lifted suspension.</p>
<p>Top models are equipped with features that include robust transmissions geared for quick directional changes, custom tires that provide enhanced traction on loose, rocky terrain, and two- or four-wheel operation for safe, effective navigation. Rear steering makes it difficult to stop a forklift quickly or swerve and still maintain control. These tools and techniques should make cleaning any lifted truck easier, but finding a good auto detailer may be the more economical option if you can afford it.</p>
