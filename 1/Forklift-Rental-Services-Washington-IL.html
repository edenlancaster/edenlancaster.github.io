<p>Pallet trucks should be durable, not disposable. More custom shops are toying around with lengthened trucks on custom chassis or even military truck chassis to create one-of-a-kind builds that get rubber-necked more than a 10-car pileup.

<p>In the case of forklifts, safe practices must be practised such as having an overhead guard that protects the operator from the accidental falling of objects which could happen whilst loading the forklift. Before you select any hydraulic pump, however, there are several important pieces of information to take into consideration that will help you match it with the right hydraulic tool, cylinder, or equipment.</p>
<p>For the development of modern Forklift Trucks, Hyster-Yale Materials plays a major role in bringing the connected device technology across the trucking industry.

Due to the presence of the boom lift, this machine is considered a partially loaded truck even without a load on the attachment.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height at which unrestricted horizontal travel is permitted, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 6 percent slope. Loads are always to be carried low to the ground, and a forklift is never to be driven with empty forks higher than 5 or 6 inches off the ground.</p>
