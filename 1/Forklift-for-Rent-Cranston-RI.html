Citizens are free to install lift kits and after-market wheels, as well as grill guards, performance shocks, and after-market bumpers.

In some cases, you may be looking to expand your business or take on work that requires equipment you don't have, like a forklift.</p>
<p>Because extreme bounce can be a common problem in lifted trucks, we suggest continuously monitoring the bounce of your lifted truck. Give special consideration to the proper functioning of tires, horn, lights, battery, controller, lift system (including load engaging means, chains, cable, and limit switches), brakes and steering mechanism.
