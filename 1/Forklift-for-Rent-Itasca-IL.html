At Leson Chevrolet, we pride ourselves on being your lifted truck dealership in the Harvey and New Orleans area. We offer competitive pricing for both our short and long-term rentals and provide prompt delivery throughout the Mid-Atlantic region.

<p>Hydraulic Pallet Truck is designed with polyurethane rollers that allow the machine to operate easily. The suspension lift kit, on the other hand, actually modifies the structure of the suspension so it sits higher off the ground, giving you significantly more ground clearance. If you've got one, you know washing a lifted truck can be tricky. Don't wait - our lifted trucks have a high interest and they won't last long.</p>
