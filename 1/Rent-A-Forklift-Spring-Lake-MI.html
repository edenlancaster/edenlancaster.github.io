<p>Simply pick up the mobile unit with any kind of forklift or truck and drive wherever you need to go. Top-notch customer service and trustworthy equipment—that's why Atlas is one of the leading Toyota forklift dealers in the Chicago, IL area. Simple does not mean you should try to install this kind of lift kit yourself, however, unless you have a lot of experience with working on truck frames and bodies and the right equipment to do it safely.</p>
<p>The result is simple: once the already-huge truck is lifted to an even huger height, it goes from "somewhat unsafe" to "incredibly scary." Not for the people in the truck, mind you. Whether you're venturing off the beaten path or commuting to work, the higher seating position makes it easier to see further down the road and over other vehicles. If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
