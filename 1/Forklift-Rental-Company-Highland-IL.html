Carefully consider lifting a brand new truck, as this can cause premature wear and added stress to critical components such as shocks, wheel bearings, suspension bushings, ball joints, and tie rods. When your load is sitting on pallets, the forklift prongs can fit easily into the pallet to move and carry your heavy load rapidly.</p>
<p>There are few vehicles that turn heads around Dayton and Troy as well as a new lifted truck Southern Comfort Automotive Performance is a manufacturer recognized upfitter, meaning they design upgrades for trucks which are then installed and sold at the dealership, giving you a custom look and feel without the headaches of taking it to an upfitter after buying it.</p>
<h2>Fork Lifting Machine Highland</h2>
<p>The size of these machines allows them to lift greater capacities than the smaller forklifts featured in this list. Heubel Shaw's large rental fleet includes Reach trucks, Stand up forklifts, sitdown 4-wheel and 3-wheel forklifts, order pickers and pallet jacks. Rather than installing between the body and frame, these kits are used to physically increase the height of the suspension for the pickup, which raises the body and frame.</p>
<p>Mechanics can also be helpful when it comes to finding a used lifted truck for purchase. The Raymond 5000 Series order picker trucks move product quickly, efficiently and comfortably. If you decide you want to lift your truck, there are two ways to do it: either a body lift or a suspension lift.

<p>You can already see that lifted trucks have some real advantages when it comes to going off-road, thanks to the greater clearance they enjoy. Operators should be trained to operate the type of trucks they work on. They should also know the potential risks for each model. Descriptive, task-oriented names (such as side loader, high-lift pallet” forklift) aside, forklifts are often referred to in more colloquial terms.</p>
<p>Most Trucks have custom suspension lift kit, off-road accessories, custom exhaust systems, billet grilles and much, much more here at Kutztown Auto. Since jacks are often electric, with some training, the same weight that is putting your employees at risk for injuries is moved with a touch of a button.
