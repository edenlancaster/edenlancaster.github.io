<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. We provide UniCarriers Forklifts including stand up and sit down trucks from 3,000 to 15,500 lb.

Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>
<p>The maximum height of lift truck forks when the mast of the lift truck has reached full extension. Winners of the FLTA ‘Archie' in Safety Excellence for the Pro 5 Series of Electric Trucks with its inbuilt Auto-Slow Down function.

All Parts are Stainless Steel including hydraulic pump, fork frame, handle, push rod, Bearings, pins and bolts, etc. Crown offers the industry's largest platform window, which provides operators the visibility they need to safely and effectively manoeuvre up and down the warehouse aisle.</p>
<p>Delta Electronics launched a 30kW wireless battery charging system, which can charge a 600Ahr-48V battery in just 60 minutes, making it ideal for large and complex vehicles, such as scissor lifts, forklifts, automated guided vehicles (AGVs) and more. The air springs will provide load support for your truck and will automatically inflate or deflate with air pressure based on the load you are attempting to carry.</p>
<p>8 Finished forklifts are shipped to the customer or distributor by truck or by rail.

Forklift rentals require research and planning, and that's where the experienced team at Thompson Lift Truck can help.</p>
<h2>Pallet Lift Tecumseh</h2>

<p>3-wheel counterbalance forklift trucks are similar to 4-wheel counterbalance machines. When altering a truck's suspension to make it higher, the vehicle's frame and body is moved up and away from the differentials. The redesign includes modifying the forklift chain and the mast inner channel to create a wider window creating better visibility. The lift trucks are used to unload, lift, lower and stack pallet loads, or other bulk loads into storage and transportation racks and facilities.</p>
<p>Add on a 6-inch lift kit and 35-inch tires on 20-inch wheels, and it's simply massive.

<p>There is nothing like the ride that is achieved from air suspension. The order picker forklift has a small platform big enough for the operator to stand behind the forks with controls for operating the forks. Suspension lift kits can raise a truck a full foot from where it started, and they aren't just lifting up the truck's body and putting it back again.
