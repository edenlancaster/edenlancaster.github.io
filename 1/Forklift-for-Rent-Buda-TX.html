<p>Stringent emission norms are driving the demand for electric forklifts. Most forklifts have a three-point suspension system. There are also leveling kits that can be applied to a pickup, which raises just the front end of the truck so that it is level with the rear. The Raymond High-capacity Reach-Fork truck integrates telematics capabilities to increase efficiency.</p>
<p>The result is simple: once the already-huge truck is lifted to an even huger height, it goes from "somewhat unsafe" to "incredibly scary." Not for the people in the truck, mind you. Whether you're venturing off the beaten path or commuting to work, the higher seating position makes it easier to see further down the road and over other vehicles. If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
