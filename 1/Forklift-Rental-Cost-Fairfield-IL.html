<p>Not ready to buy new but need a material handling solution right away we have a good selection of used material handling equipment to choose from on a regular basis. A lifted truck with a higher center of gravity is not going to handle the way a stock truck with a lower center of gravity is. Forget tight turns and swift maneuvering on a lifted truck. Improperly installed lift kits will make for a rougher ride at best, and will be a tremendous safety hazard at worst. Designed for heavy loads, high reach, and extreme maneuverability, a forklift can make quick work of moving, loading, storing and unloading all sorts of loads.</p>
<p>However, industrial-grade masts do reportedly provide more substantial lifting capacity at height, with 6,000-lb and 8,000-lb capacity lifts serving as two popular examples among a number of rental houses. Their manoeuvrability, tires and traction force make them very popular in industries where very heavy loads must be transported on rough or unpaved grounds.</p>
<h2>Safe Pallet Racking Fairfield </h2>
<p>The sense of rotation of the control handle is intended to be in the same direction as the desired motion of the mast or load.

<p>As many models in our fleet feature four wheel drive, these machines are ideal to work outside carrying out heavy duty operations. Today many business owners are meeting the tasks of material movement with the help of these hand pallet trucks. Courtesy Chevrolet does our lifted trucks in house so you know you are getting a great deal and a quality job done.</p>
<p>There's a wide variety of styles and designs available, some capable of moving loads of 5000lbs, but the main difference is between the lift and pallet trucks. Still, with the right business plan, it can be achieved with a good level of success - forklifts are always in demand in various industries. Most rental companies use Toyota forklift models due to their reputation for safety and performance.</p>
