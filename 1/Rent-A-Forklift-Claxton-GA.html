We are able to meet your long-term and short-term forklift requirements whether you are based within close proximity to a major city or in a small town.

<p>If it is only to be used for a handful of hours each week, you can safely settle for a used forklift that is ten to twelve years old, because you are likely to get another seven or eight years of useful service out of it. Buyers can make the mistake of only opting for more recent models of used fork trucks, but far more important than this is the number of operating hours and the overall condition of the second hand truck for sale.</p>
<p>If you are an adventurous individual or you just need a truck with significant size and power, then you definitely have to test drive one of our lifted trucks.

<p>Gas powered forklifts are more popular than their electric counterparts. Although they are versatile machines, you'll need the right size for the job. Our Rental Purchase Option (RPO) provides customers with an opportunity to acquire equipment by building equity over the rental period. When properly operated and maintained, a forklift is an invaluable piece of equipment.</p>
<p>We back most used forklifts with a 1 year parts and labour warranty. With excellent machine and load stability due to an optimum centre of gravity and suspension provided by large diameter tyres, these machines provide high mobility and great productivity in rough terrain environments. It is rumored that electric forklifts are maintenance free due to less moving parts and their cleaner environments.</p>
<p>The Industrial Truck Association (ITA) is responsible for defining the classification of the industrial Forklift Trucks and also is responsible for imposing a set of rules and regulations on the industries using the Forklift Trucks. We pride ourselves on providing a wide variety of equipment options for every application, while our full service branch offers used equipment sales, short and long term rentals, emergency and preventative maintenance.</p>

<p>This enables a controlled lifting and elevating of the pallet. In the future, the Chinese Forklift Market will still have huge growth potentials and forklift sales in 2023 will double that in 2018. These are some of the reasons why this pallet jack truck could be the one you are looking for. ForkliftTrader is always looking for new inventory. If you are allowed to test drive some lifted trucks alone, you may need to bring in documents like copies of your driver's license.</p>
