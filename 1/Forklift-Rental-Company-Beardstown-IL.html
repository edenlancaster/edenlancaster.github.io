This Motorised pallet truck is used in several industries for lifting purposes and due to its long functional life.

We buy and sell used forklifts, aerial lifts, rail car movers, attachments, racking & shelving and surplus warehouse equipment. The 2C5000 became the primary model in 2010 and had maintained its status as one of the premier forklift models ever since.</p>
<p>First forklifts appeared already in the early 20th century, and were used in World War II. Today, forklift trucks facilitate work of thousands of people, especially in manufacturing and warehousing sectors. One of the main safety risks for order pickers is falling from height when exiting the cabin onto pallets, partially enclosed platforms or racking. Our hand pallet jack import data solutions meet your actual import requirements in quality, volume, seasonality, and geography.</p>
<p>They have small tires designed to run on paved surfaces and are usually powered by an internal combustion engine running on gasoline, diesel, or propane fuel. Lift Capacity: 16000 lbs.
