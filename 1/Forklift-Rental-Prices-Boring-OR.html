<p>A lifted truck, often referred to as a 4x4 truck, is a modified vehicle specially designed for off road driving and other types of high-impact work. At a minimum, you should have a card or certificate of proof of training and the vehicle load charts (and attachment load charts as well, if applicable) on the jobsite—OSHA will look for these items first.

Monster street truck drivers are at the distinct disadvantage in close quarters when maneuvering, such as in stop-and-go driving, city traffic, and even parking.
