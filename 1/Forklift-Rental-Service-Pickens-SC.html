<h3>Online Forklift Training Pickens SC</h3>
<p>Similar to standard counterbalanced forklifts, NA and VNA lifts can support from 3,000 to 12,000 lbs and are available in a range of three or four-stage masts that offer lift heights up to 31 feet, as well as multiple chassis designs. Most trucks on the market today are built with what is commonly referred to as a body-on-frame design; the frame is built for the engine, drivetrain, and suspension, then a separate body is attached to the frame.</p>
<p>For others, it's the enhanced functionality and driver satisfaction that makes these trucks attractive choice. Standard forklifts have little ground clearance as they are predominantly operated on solid smooth surfaces such as concrete floors.
