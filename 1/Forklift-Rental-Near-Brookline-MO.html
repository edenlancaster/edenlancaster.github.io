<p>In an Order Picking Forklift the Operator goes up into the air with the load and either places pallets mechanically, or moves smaller loads on and off the order picker manually. Well, you're going to have to work a little bit harder than a 6” suspension lift to pimp your truck out, but it's still doable. Theoretically this is to increase off-road performance, although the higher center of gravity would likely make them more likely to roll over on rough terrain.</p>
<p>The G2 features a 4 inch elevated off road suspension lift, custom G2 wheels, and 33 inch all-terrain tires. Included in this class are lift trucks with 3 or 4 wheels and either cushion (solid) or pneumatic (air filled) tires. Four-wheel-drive is usually a selectable system designed to give better performance on broken terrain in low grip road conditions. A lifted truck can provide you with greater ground clearance beneath your truck, even if you choose a simple lift kit, which can help you with going off-road with your pickup.</p>

We have specialized in new and used forklift sales in Surrey, Vancouver and surrounding areas for over 41 years.
