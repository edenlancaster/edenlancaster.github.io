Another subtype of warehouse forklift, the counterbalance forklift, looks like a standard warehouse forklift—except it has no extending arms for the forward forks and the back is weighted to counterbalance the load.

Counterbalance forklifts are very versatile and are available in three or four wheeled models, have two forks protruding from the front of the machine, and have a counterbalance weight in the back of the truck to ensure loads don't create an imbalance.</p>
