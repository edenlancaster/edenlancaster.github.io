<p>Not ready to buy new but need a material handling solution right away we have a good selection of used material handling equipment to choose from on a regular basis. A lifted truck with a higher center of gravity is not going to handle the way a stock truck with a lower center of gravity is. Forget tight turns and swift maneuvering on a lifted truck. Improperly installed lift kits will make for a rougher ride at best, and will be a tremendous safety hazard at worst. Designed for heavy loads, high reach, and extreme maneuverability, a forklift can make quick work of moving, loading, storing and unloading all sorts of loads.</p>
<p>Raymond's ACR System (advanced AC motor control system) delivers powerful AC drive and lift that reduces downtime and increases warehouse productivity enabling faster, smoother operation while increasing operator confidence and lowering total cost of ownership.

Ahern specializes in high reach equipment, which permits the safe lifting of people or materials to work at height.</p>
<p>This Nationally Recognised and WorkSafe Victoria Accredited Unit allows you to perform work that requires a forklift truck high risk work (HRW) licence.

When your load is sitting on pallets, the forklift prongs can fit easily into the pallet to move and carry your heavy load rapidly.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we offer our customers the possibility of covering their machinery damage with STILL Rental Plus. This is the total amount of weight the forklift can move off the ground. The smallest of the modern pneumatic style forklifts, the 3,000 lb. pneumatic is ideal for light-duty outdoor applications.

<p>Often, this is not as easy to accomplish with the transmission or transfer case side of the driveshaft, and your U-joint-style driveshaft is best tossed for a custom unit, using a double cardan or CV joint that can run smoothly at higher angles. Where possible, fork loops or jugs should be provided for handling by fork trucks. Whilst implementing some or all of the relevant measures above will greatly reduce the fall risk to operators, the best solution is to provide order pickers with fully enclosed platforms.</p>
