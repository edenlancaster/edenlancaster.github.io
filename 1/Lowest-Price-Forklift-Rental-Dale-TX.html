<p>As the name implies, reach trucks reach” into racking with an extendable carriage and forks to grab pallets that range from 2,500 to 5,500 lbs. This version is known as a deep-reach lift truck. The choice to lift your truck or not is ultimately going to come down to what you use the vehicle for and what you hope to get out of lifting it. If you are an avid off-roader, then the benefit of higher clearance will probably outweigh the drawbacks.</p>
<h2>Diesel, Electric Or LPG Forklift Trucks Dale </h2>

Whether they be a factory-floor, rough terrain, or telehandler machine, forklifts often face far harder service than most farm machinery.

Having rust free suspension components when we go to install a lift, makes for a smooth transition from stock to lifted.

<p>Sit down forklift has a seat for a rider which faces the mast. At Lifted Trucks Only we like to say that we are in the business of making automotive dreams a reality.
