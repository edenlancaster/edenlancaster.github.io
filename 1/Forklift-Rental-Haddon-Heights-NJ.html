Because of the nature of their work and the environments in which they operate, using rough terrain forklifts can also pose numerous hazards.</p>

Built for the extreme, the WT Series platform pallet truck features a cast-steel reinforced chassis, up to 12 mm thick covers, die-cast aluminum handle and the toughest side restraints available.</p>
