Come marvel at truly remarkable pieces of mechanical art as we explore a little bit into what a real lifted truck looks like. Our customers come to us because of our commitment to service excellence and our varied product offering which includes new forklifts for sale, used, rentals and more.</p>
<p>If it is only to be used for a handful of hours each week, you can safely settle for a used forklift that is ten to twelve years old, because you are likely to get another seven or eight years of useful service out of it. Buyers can make the mistake of only opting for more recent models of used fork trucks, but far more important than this is the number of operating hours and the overall condition of the second hand truck for sale.</p>
<p>Sit-down forklifts are also more accessible to a wider pool of forklift operators for that reason. Some of these can also save you on the purchase of unnecessary equipment by converting a rough terrain forklift to a number of other heavy industrial machines. Lift Capacity: 6000 lbs. First, forklifts can be classified according to the type of engine. Renting a forklift requires almost as much forethought as buying one.</p>
