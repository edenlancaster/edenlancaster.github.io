Never try to stop a pallet jack with hands or feet, this could cause serious injury, especially with a very heavy load.

<h3>Forklift Industry Danville IL</h3>

To achieve worker safety, Raymond developed the Raymond virtual reality (VR) simulator , a supplemental educational tool that helps new and experienced operators learn and practice forklift operating skills on an actual truck in a secure, warehouse environment.

<p>CENTER CONTROL: The operator control position is located near the center of the truck.
