<p>Before you decide to lift your truck, it's important to understand some of the pros and cons of driving a lifted vehicle. If your forklift is overloaded, it can cause it to tip to the side when you turn or when you are near a steep edge. Forklifts run on diesel, liquid propane and electric. If you have previously owned a forklift, determine what aspects you liked and didn't like about the lift.</p>

Heubel Shaw's large rental fleet includes Reach trucks, Stand up forklifts, sitdown 4-wheel and 3-wheel forklifts, order pickers and pallet jacks. Rather than installing between the body and frame, these kits are used to physically increase the height of the suspension for the pickup, which raises the body and frame.</p>

Designed by CASE, Load Control automatically provides on-the-go mast cushioning that lessens load shock when traveling over uneven terrain. A big lifted truck looks rugged and will surely turn some heads, but there are good practical applications to lifting truck aside from making it look good.</p>
