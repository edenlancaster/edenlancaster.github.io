Unlike other forklifts, these material handling vehicles don't have cabs.

<p>The second type of lift kit is the suspension lift kit. The average pallet jack can lift about 5,000 pounds (2,268 kg).

As with mid-level order pickers, high-level order pickers also have a load capacity of 3,000 pounds.</p>
