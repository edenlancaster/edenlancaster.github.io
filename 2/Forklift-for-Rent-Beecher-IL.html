Counterbalance forklift is characterized by its stability with the low center of gravity in its structure. Many manufacturers opt for watertight wheel bearings, a hydraulic elevator or a built-in pump to ensure their rough terrain pallet jacks are easy and comfortable to use, even in the harshest conditions.</p>

That's why Linde develops entirely individual order pickers based on a modular system, featuring, for example, different mast heights, working platforms, chassis sizes, and operating and control concepts.</p>
<p>At Eagle Forklift Sales & Service, we understand that loyalty needs to be earned through trust, value, consistency, service, and more. All of the key components of the forklift including wheels, counterweight and mast are attached to the truck frame. Most forklift rentals give general training for handling the rented equipment.
