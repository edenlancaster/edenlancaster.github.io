<p>TYPES OF FORKLIFTS: fork crane models for industrial use within warehouses, hydraulic three-wheeled electric forklifts, etc. These types of forklifts can accelerate and travel at higher speeds, which also makes them ideal for outdoor uses. More elaborate lift kits not only raise the body of your truck up but can also increase the clearance of your truck's frame and let you put bigger tires on your pickup. Take a closer look at the most important features to find out how rough terrain forklifts get the job done.</p>
<p>This added weight increases the lifting capacity of the unit to between 2,200 and 4,000 lb. The load center is the distance from the forks to the center of gravity of the load.

<p>Between a 45° forward tilt and a 15° rear tilt, the H Series forklift offers the most mast tilt in the industry, allowing operators to keep loads level on any terrain or slope. A lift kit gives your truck a lot of added benefits that other trucks don't have. Lifted trucks get instant attention on the streets, and if you're looking for off-road performance, the extra ground clearance in a lifted truck can mean the difference between an exciting run, and walking home.</p>
