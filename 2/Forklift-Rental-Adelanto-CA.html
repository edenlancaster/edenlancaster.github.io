<p>On the other hand, there are order picker trucks that have forks that are fixed in front of the platform and thus cannot be moved. As a result, drivers will feel sleek and cool behind the wheel of some cheap used lifted trucks for sale. The SP Series 4-wheel platform stock picker is a heavy-duty stand-up lift truck used in areas where loads are bulky or extra long, such as furniture or department store warehouses.</p>

<p>Forklift Trucks have a significant and higher share across the food and beverage industry. For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical as defined in Test OP1, or at full rearward tilt, whichever is less stable. I notice two things right off the bat; one, the truck looks just about at home up there on that lift kit as it does on its stock ride height; and two, it hasn't seemed to have aged.</p>
