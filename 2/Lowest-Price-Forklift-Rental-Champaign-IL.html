<p>Xtreme's new range made it into Construction Equipment magazine's top 100 products awards for 2018. Whether you're using your forklift for manufacturing or retail, these brands offer better visibility, better safety and ease of use for faster overall performance.

For a full 25-foot (7.6 m) forward reach, the load capacity of this forklift is reduced to 2,000 pounds (908 kg) without outriggers, or stabilizing legs, and 3,250 pounds (148 kg) with outriggers.</p>
<p>A little more lifting capacity means the 3,500 lb. forklift can do more than the 3,000 lb. But you don't have to sacrifice the small footprint, as the truck sits on the same size frame. Prominent & Leading Manufacturer from New Delhi, we offer hand pallet truck, hydraulic floor crane g type, hydraulic floor crane u type, drum lifter cum tilter stacker, full electric stackers and semi electric stacker.</p>
<p>Lift kits can put added pressure on the driveshaft angles , causing intense vibrations at peak speeds.
