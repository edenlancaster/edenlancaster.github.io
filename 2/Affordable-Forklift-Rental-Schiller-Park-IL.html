<p>These forklifts are much quieter, and because they are typically in a cleaner environment they will last much longer. We offer complete warehouse equipment solutions including warehouse design, warehouse storage, layout, conveyors, pallet rack, cantilever rack, dock equipment and repair, as well as scissor lift tables. The PTH hand pallet truck with powered scissor lift can be electrically raised to a maximum work height of 800 mm, avoiding unnecessary bending and heavy lifting.</p>
<p>The result is simple: once the already-huge truck is lifted to an even huger height, it goes from "somewhat unsafe" to "incredibly scary." Not for the people in the truck, mind you. Whether you're venturing off the beaten path or commuting to work, the higher seating position makes it easier to see further down the road and over other vehicles. If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
