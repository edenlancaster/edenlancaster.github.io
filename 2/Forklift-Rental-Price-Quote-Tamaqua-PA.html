Many locations have specialized car dealerships that work with modified vehicles such as lifted trucks.

In this guide, we'll show you how to choose the correct shocks for a truck equipped with a lift kit.</p>
<p>Just like with tires, wheels are also rated to carry a load, and most ratings max out at a specific tire size. Loads may fall or forklifts can easily be turned over tilting moderate loads.
