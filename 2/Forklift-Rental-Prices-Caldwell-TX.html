<p>It's really yes and no. You don't have to earn certification for a Toyota electric forklift and a Caterpillar diesel forklift. Rotator - to aid the handling of skids that may have become excessively tilted and other specialty material handling needs some forklifts are fitted with an attachment that allows the tines to be rotated.
