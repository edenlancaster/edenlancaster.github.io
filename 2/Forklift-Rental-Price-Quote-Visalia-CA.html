<p>Reach trucks have baselegs extending from the tractor to support the load. Some of the pallet trucks also independently reduce high speeds when cornering, adjust their drive behavior to the current situation, or help when climbing gradients. Rather than increasing the distance between the body and the frame, a suspension lift kit either replaces or adjusts the truck's leaf springs to lift its suspension.</p>

<p>116 Effective Powered Industrial Truck Operator Training Program Four major areas of concern must be addressed:  The general hazards that apply to the operation of all or most powered industrial trucks;  The hazards associated with the operation of particular types of trucks;  The hazards of workplaces generally; and,  The hazards of the particular workplace where the vehicle operates.</p>
<p>That is the principle upon which every detail of the design of these order pickers is based: The low entry height is gentle on the legs when mounting and dismounting, platforms with non-slip mats that are decoupled from the chassis by rubber supports reduce the effect of vibrations, and operation is simple thanks to ergonomically arranged and shaped control panels.</p>

<p>Supporting a forklift platform is operated on a firm flat surface. If you need the forklift to operate under a fixed height structure, such as a container door then you should also consider the collapsed height of the mast. With maximum lift capacities of 6,000 and 8,000 pounds, respectively, JCB's 930 and 940 rough-terrain, straight-mast forklift models are purpose-built with a one-piece frame.</p>

Remember: you always want to buy a forklift that has a slightly higher load capacity than what you think you will need. The mast is capable of rotating 90 degrees, and the forks can then advance like on a reach mechanism, to pick full pallets.</p>
