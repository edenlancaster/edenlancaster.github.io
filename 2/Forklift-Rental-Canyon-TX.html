<p>Class VII - Rough terrain forklift is a generic term used to describe forklifts typically intended for use on unimproved natural terrain and disturbed terrain construction sites. Also, 4,000 lb. trucks use a heavier battery to counteract the heavier load on the forks. The order selector operators ride up and down with the load and must be secured to the truck using a belt and tether system.</p>
<p>As many models in our fleet feature four wheel drive, these machines are ideal to work outside carrying out heavy duty operations. Today many business owners are meeting the tasks of material movement with the help of these hand pallet trucks. Courtesy Chevrolet does our lifted trucks in house so you know you are getting a great deal and a quality job done.</p>

If the truck is originally equipped with front end attachments, the truck nameplate shall also be marked to identify the attachments and show the approximate weight of the truck and attachment combination and capacity of the truck and attachment combination at maximum elevation of the load engaging means with load laterally centered.</p>
