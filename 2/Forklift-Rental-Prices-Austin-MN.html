<p>Trucks Only has a great inventory full of lifted trucks to browse through. So we have, on the one hand, electric forklifts and, on the other, internal combustion. Automatic parking brake, electronic speed control and braking system provide enhanced driver safety and also contribute to the BT Pro Lifter's long operating life and low lifetime cost. Heavier loads shift the center of gravity forward even further.</p>
<p>This system is a result of the various types of forklift training available. In addition, the use of a powered industrial truck in a location for which that type of powered industrial truck is not designated for use, for example due to a flammable atmosphere, can result in a fire or explosion. This means that Linde reach trucks can maneuver safely and quickly, even in confined spaces and handling conditions in warehouses.</p>
