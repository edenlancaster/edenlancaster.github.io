Most Forklift Dealers will provide operator training (sometimes with a cost) with the purchase of a new forklift.

Like the base model 3-wheel forklift, the basic 4-wheel capacity is 3,000 lb. But the difference between the two types of trucks is that 4-wheels don't quite have the maneuverability of 3-wheels.</p>
<p>United Rentals is an Authorized Dealer for Motorola and can provide a variety of handheld and portable radio solutions. These manual pallet jacks are ideal for special applications. However, for a warehouse with narrow aisles, having a maneuverable forklift capable of reaching in excess of ten meters makes the reach truck a considerable adversary in the right conditions.</p>
<h3>Hyster Forklift Feasterville Trevose PA</h3>

The Toyota Order Picker easily maneuvers narrow aisles in warehouses with minimized rack impact during case picking thanks to optional wire guidance and double rail guidance systems. Industrial and powered pallet jacks in general weigh more than standard light-duty models.</p>

Weight capacity for Class II machines generally ranges from 3,000-5,000 lbs.
