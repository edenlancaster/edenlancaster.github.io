The AUSA 3000-3500 kg forklifts are compact, have a high-performance hydrostatic transmission and are available in 2-wheel drive and 4x4 versions. Lift trucks use either gasoline-powered engines, diesel engines, or electric motors, with the power supplied by a rechargable industrial battery.</p>
<p>It is impractical to build a guard of sufficient strength to withstand the impact of a falling capacity load since such a guard would constitute a safety hazard because its structure would be so large that it might interfere with good visibility, and would weigh so much that it might make the truck top-heavy and unstable. These Class 5 forklifts, sometimes called Yard Trucks,‚Äù are larger when compared to a Cushion tire unit of equal capacity and offer a softer ride.</p>
<p>This safety switch (which can be a pedal or other special safety harness) will prevent the the lift truck from moving unless activated by the operator. It is important to be aware of the potential hazards of order picker trucks. This is ideal if you have multiple loads in one bay that you can access from different angles, as the truck can grab loads further back.</p>
