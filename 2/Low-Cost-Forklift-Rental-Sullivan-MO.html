The scale of materials transported and lifts used varies greatly depending on the type of industry in question.</p>
<h2>Forklift Attachments Make Your Forklift A Multi Faceted Tool Sullivan </h2>

A fatigued forklift operator is one of the most dangerous things to have on a jobsite.

<p>Our counterbalanced fork trucks are ideal for operations that require breakdown of pallets removed from trailers, long runs to P&D stations, or a combination of both.
