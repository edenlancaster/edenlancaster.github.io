We also rent manual pallet jacks, electric carts, scissor lifts, ramps, and various forklift attachments such as rotators, clamps, carpet poles, and extensions.</p>

In our inventory you can explore a variety of new and used electric, internal combustion, and rough terrain forklifts, as well as a number of boom lifts and floor cleaners.</p>
<p>It is impractical to build a guard of sufficient strength to withstand the impact of a falling capacity load since such a guard would constitute a safety hazard because its structure would be so large that it might interfere with good visibility, and would weigh so much that it might make the truck top-heavy and unstable. These Class 5 forklifts, sometimes called Yard Trucks,” are larger when compared to a Cushion tire unit of equal capacity and offer a softer ride.</p>
<p>Ohio Power Tool carries a wide selection of jack stands (truck air jack stands, vehicle support jack stands, forklift jack stands, pin-type jack stands, and truck ramps) that offer capacities of 3-25 tons. Unlike most car repairs or upgrades, lifting a truck requires a little more effort than getting a few gearhead friends together on a Sunday afternoon to gather around a toolbox and a twelve-pack.</p>

OSHA standards require that the employer ensure that forklift operator is competent to operate the forklift he or she is assigned to use.</p>
<p>Hyster® i3 Technology integrates commonality among Hyster warehouse products and simplifies the way in which operators and technicians alike handle and service the truck.
