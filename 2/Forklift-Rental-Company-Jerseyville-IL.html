<p>Because there is no load, the center of gravity is nearly in the center of the forklift's counterbalance. We have both weekly and monthly forklift rentals available that are structured around our clients' specific needs. Used in different warehouses and go-downs, the offered pallet truck is known for its excellent load carrying capacity. While Sit-down riders provide operator comfort, stand up trucks are better suited to applications where operators are getting on and off the trucks many times an hour.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height at which unrestricted horizontal travel is permitted, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 6 percent slope. Loads are always to be carried low to the ground, and a forklift is never to be driven with empty forks higher than 5 or 6 inches off the ground.</p>

Ask the seller whether the forklift for sale is in usable condition, that the forks, mast, back rest, seat, chain and tires are undamaged, and if it has been involved in any accidents.</p>
