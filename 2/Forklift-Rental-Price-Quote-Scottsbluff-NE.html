<p>In addition, alternate rated capacities may be established at other load centers and other platform heights. It happens because the one side of the chain is fixed to the immovable frame of the forklift, and the only way by which masts can move upward is when gears rotate in clockwise direction and pull the forks overhead. Raising your truck can help making towing easier, as the increased ground clearance makes loading and unloading more accessible.</p>
<p>Always drive unloaded trucks with the forks downgrade. Have brakes set and wheel blocks in place to prevent movement of trucks, trailers, or railroad cars while loading or unloading. Are you looking for a used lifted 4×4 truck for sale, if so, then you came to the right place.
