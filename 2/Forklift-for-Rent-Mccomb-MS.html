<p>Welcome to the home of Doosan Forklifts in the UK. It is also permissible to use two test loads of equal weight suspended from the ends of a transverse beam fastened to a framework supported by the forks as described in item 3, provided the loads are suspended from points equidistance from centerline of trucks, and provided that a straight line from one point to the other passes at a height above the forks and at a distance from front face of forks equal to the rated load center dimension before weight of test load has caused forks to deflect.</p>

<p>High-level order pickers enable an operator to pick cases or items from 20 feet to 35 feet.

<p>For the most part, trucks are made with body over frame” construction, which means that there is a basic metal frame for the truck and then the body of the truck is placed onto that frame and attached. As a result, with the adoption of advanced technology, there are substantial market opportunities, owing to the efforts of the manufacturers that are indulged in manufacturing forklift trucks that are technologically driven.</p>
<p>Due to this reason, we work hard to offer some cheap used lifted trucks for sale. Body lift kits are also typically the least expensive option when looking to lift a truck; however, a gap is created by the spacer between the body and frame. Today, rough terrain forklifts are some of the most versatile machines you'll find on a job site. The Raymond 9800 pallet truck is the ultimate very narrow aisle lift truck.</p>
